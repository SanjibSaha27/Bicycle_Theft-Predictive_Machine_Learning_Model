**Bicycle Theft Predictive Machine Learning Model**

The purpose of this project is to:

-Get & prepare the data:

    Load and explore the dataset referenced in section 4 in this document using techniques learnt during this course.

    Visualize the data and describe it thoroughly, identify correlations, etc.

    Clean, transform categorical data, and model the dataset using the techniques learnt throughout the course in
    preparation for building a predictive model.
    
-Build a supervised predictive model based using a suitable classification algorithm in python and utilizing scikit-learn,
pandas, numpy, etc., to provide predictions as specified in project specification, section 3 of this report.

-Validate/score and evaluate the models and choose the best model.

-Build an API for the model using the python Flask framework.

-Build a simple front end to access the API and pass new feature values to the prediction model.
